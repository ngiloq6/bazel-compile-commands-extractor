# This file existed originally to enable quick local development via local_repository from WORKSPACE-based projects.
    # See ./ImplementationReadme.md for details on local development.
    # Why? local_repository doesn't work without a WORKSPACE, and new_local_repository requires overwriting the BUILD file (as of Bazel 7).

workspace(name = "hedron_compile_commands")

# Note that we're now using Bzlmod inside this repo during development, so things should be added to MODULE.bazel or, if needed, workspace_setup.bzl.
